# measurie
When an American user introduces a dialect with arcane freedom terms such as "Fahrenheits" and "inches", this bot helps you translate them into normal measurement systems (and the other way around, if you need to). It also helps you with confusing time zones, and skips American small talk with weather checking commands :)
